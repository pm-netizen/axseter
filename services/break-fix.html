                    <h2>The Challenge of Distributed Infrastructure Support</h2>
                    <p>When a camera goes offline in your Phoenix location at 8am, you need it fixed—not a game of phone tag trying to find a local contractor who can respond promptly. When an access control reader fails at your Atlanta branch, your facilities team shouldn't have to research vendors and negotiate service terms while employees wait outside.</p>
                    
                    <p>For organizations with locations across the country, maintaining low-voltage infrastructure presents a persistent operational challenge. Structured cabling, access control, video surveillance, and AV systems all require occasional service—whether that's repairing failed components, troubleshooting connectivity issues, or handling moves, adds, and changes as your business evolves.</p>
                    
                    <p>Managing these service needs through a patchwork of regional contractors is time-consuming and unpredictable. Different contractors have different response times, pricing structures, and quality standards. Your facilities team spends valuable time coordinating rather than focusing on strategic initiatives.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Axseter's Break-Fix Solution</h2>
                    <p>Axseter extends our Single Point of Contact model beyond installation to ongoing support. Whether we originally installed your systems or you're bringing us on to support infrastructure deployed by others, we serve as your nationwide service partner for all low-voltage support needs.</p>
                    
                    <p>One relationship covers all your locations. One phone number dispatches a technician to any site. One service agreement defines response times and pricing across your entire portfolio. Your facilities and IT teams stop managing vendors and start managing outcomes.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our nationwide technician network means we have boots on the ground wherever you have locations. When you submit a service request, we dispatch from our network—no searching for available contractors, no onboarding new vendors, no explaining your standards to someone who's never worked in your facilities before.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Service Capabilities</h2>
                    
                    <h3>On-Demand Repairs</h3>
                    <p>Hardware fails. Cables get damaged. Connections come loose. When something breaks, Axseter responds. We troubleshoot the issue, dispatch a technician with appropriate parts, and restore functionality. Our technicians arrive with the context of your standardized systems, reducing diagnosis time and ensuring proper repairs.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Moves, Adds, and Changes (MAC)</h3>
                    <p>Your infrastructure needs evolve as your business changes. Axseter handles MAC requests across all low-voltage systems: adding network drops for new workstations, relocating cameras to cover reconfigured spaces, adding card readers for new secured areas, updating conference room technology. We maintain your deployment standards while accommodating operational changes.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Preventive Maintenance</h3>
                    <p>Proactive maintenance extends equipment life and prevents unplanned outages. We offer scheduled maintenance programs that include firmware updates, system health checks, cable testing, cleaning, and performance optimization. Preventive care is especially valuable for security systems where reliability is critical.</p>
                    
                    <h3>System Troubleshooting</h3>
                    <p>Not every issue has an obvious cause. When systems behave unexpectedly—intermittent connectivity, poor video quality, access control glitches—our technicians diagnose root causes and implement solutions. We document findings so recurring issues can be addressed systematically.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Emergency Response</h3>
                    <p>Some situations can't wait for next-day service. When security systems fail at critical locations or infrastructure outages impact business operations, we offer expedited response options including same-day and 4-hour emergency service for qualified situations.</p>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Systems We Support</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Structured Cabling</h3>
                    <p>Cable repairs, port activations, patch panel management, cable certification, and connectivity troubleshooting. We maintain the network infrastructure foundation that all your systems depend on.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Access Control</h3>
                    <p>Reader repairs and replacements, door hardware service, controller troubleshooting, credential programming assistance, and integration maintenance. We keep your facilities secure and your employees moving.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Video Surveillance</h3>
                    <p>Camera repairs, NVR/VMS troubleshooting, storage management, image quality optimization, and system health monitoring. We ensure your surveillance infrastructure captures what you need.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Audio-Visual</h3>
                    <p>Display repairs, conference system troubleshooting, digital signage maintenance, audio system service, and room control programming. We keep your meeting spaces and communication systems operational.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Sound Masking</h3>
                    <p>Emitter repairs, zone adjustments, coverage optimization, and control system maintenance. We maintain the acoustic privacy your spaces require.</p>

                    <h2>Service Models</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Time and Materials (T&M)</h3>
                    <p>For organizations with moderate support needs or those wanting to evaluate our service before committing to a contract, we offer time-and-materials support. You pay for service as needed at established hourly rates plus parts. No commitment required—just reliable service when you need it.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Service Contracts</h3>
                    <p>For organizations with ongoing support requirements, service contracts provide defined SLAs, preferred pricing, dedicated communication channels, and predictable budgeting. Contracts are customized based on your location count, system complexity, and service level requirements.</p>
                    
                    <p>Contract tiers typically include:</p>
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li><strong>Standard:</strong> Next business day response, business hours support</li>
                        <li><strong>Priority:</strong> Same-day response, extended hours support</li>
                        <li><strong>Critical:</strong> 4-hour response, 24/7 support for designated systems</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Managed Services</h3>
                    <p>For clients who want comprehensive infrastructure management, we offer managed service arrangements that include proactive monitoring, scheduled maintenance, and strategic planning alongside break-fix support. This model works well for organizations without dedicated low-voltage expertise on staff.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>How It Works</h2>
                    
                    <h3>1. Request Submission</h3>
                    <p>Service requests come in via phone, email, or our online portal. Provide the location, system affected, and issue description. You'll receive a ticket number immediately for tracking purposes.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Triage and Dispatch</h3>
                    <p>Our service coordination team reviews the request, assesses priority based on your service agreement, and dispatches a technician from our network. For straightforward issues, we dispatch immediately. For complex problems, we may conduct initial remote troubleshooting to ensure the technician arrives prepared.</p>
                    
                    <h3>3. On-Site Service</h3>
                    <p>The technician arrives with knowledge of your systems and standards. They diagnose the issue, perform repairs or replacements, and verify the system is functioning properly before leaving. Parts are sourced from our inventory or ordered as needed.</p>
                    
                    <h3>4. Documentation and Closure</h3>
                    <p>Every service visit is documented—what was found, what was done, and any recommendations for future attention. You receive a completion notification and can access service history through our portal.</p>
                    
                    <h3>5. Continuous Improvement</h3>
                    <p>We analyze service patterns across your portfolio to identify systemic issues. If certain locations or equipment types generate repeated service calls, we recommend proactive solutions to reduce future incidents.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>The SPoC Advantage for Support</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Consistent Service Quality</h3>
                    <p>Our technicians work from documented standards and have access to your system configurations. You get consistent service quality regardless of which location needs attention.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Simplified Administration</h3>
                    <p>One vendor, one contract, one invoice. Your accounts payable team processes one monthly statement instead of dozens. Your facilities team manages one relationship instead of coordinating multiple contractors.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Institutional Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>We maintain documentation of your systems across all locations. When issues arise, technicians have context about your infrastructure, past service history, and organizational standards.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Scalable Coverage</h3>
                    <p>As you open new locations, they're automatically covered under your existing service relationship. No new vendor onboarding, no new contracts to negotiate. Just consistent support that grows with your organization.</p>

                    <h2>Common Questions</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>What is your typical response time for break-fix requests?</h3>
                    <p>Standard response is next business day for most locations. We offer same-day and 4-hour emergency response options for critical issues. Response times are defined in your service agreement based on location tier and system criticality.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Do I need a service contract for break-fix support?</h3>
                    <p>No. Axseter offers both contract-based support with defined SLAs and pricing, as well as time-and-materials support for ad-hoc requests. Many clients start with T&M and move to a contract once they understand their support volume.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What systems does Axseter support?</h3>
                    <p>We provide break-fix support for all low-voltage systems including structured cabling, access control, video surveillance, audio-visual, sound masking, and related infrastructure. If we installed it, we support it. We also take over support for systems installed by others.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How do I request service?</h3>
                    <p>Service requests can be submitted via phone, email, or our online portal. You'll receive a ticket number for tracking and updates on technician dispatch and completion. For contract clients, we provide dedicated contact channels.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Can you support systems you didn't install?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. While we have the deepest familiarity with systems we deployed, we regularly take over support for infrastructure installed by others. We'll conduct an initial assessment to document your systems and establish baseline conditions.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How is pricing structured?</h3>
                    <p>T&M service is billed at established hourly rates plus parts and travel costs. Contract pricing is customized based on your location count, service level requirements, and anticipated volume. We provide transparent pricing with no surprise fees.</p>
