                    <h2>Enterprise Video Surveillance at Scale</h2>
                    <p>Video surveillance is no longer just about recording incidents—it's a business intelligence tool that protects assets, deters theft, supports operations, and provides accountability across your organization. For multi-location enterprises, the challenge is deploying and managing video systems consistently across a distributed portfolio.</p>
                    
                    <p>Organizations with dozens or hundreds of locations often find themselves with a patchwork of video systems: different camera brands at different sites, aging DVRs that can't be accessed remotely, and no centralized way to review footage across the enterprise. This fragmentation creates security gaps and operational inefficiencies that compound as you grow.</p>
                    
                    <p>Axseter brings enterprise discipline to video surveillance deployment. We serve as your nationwide installation partner, ensuring consistent execution, installation quality, and integration standards whether you're deploying cameras at a clinic in Tampa or a branch office in Portland.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>The Axseter Approach</h2>
                    <p>Our Single Point of Contact model simplifies enterprise video surveillance programs. Instead of managing relationships with regional security contractors—each with their own installation standards and support processes—you work with one Axseter project manager who coordinates deployments nationwide.</p>
                    
                    <p>We begin by understanding your security objectives, compliance requirements, and operational workflows. Whether you're focused on loss prevention, workplace safety, liability protection, or operational visibility, these goals shape camera placement, retention policies, and system configuration decisions.</p>
                    
                    <p>From there, we develop standardized deployment specifications for your location types. A retail storefront has different surveillance needs than a medical clinic or corporate office. We define camera types, placement standards, storage requirements, and integration points for each environment, ensuring every new location deploys a system optimized for its specific use case.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>Video Surveillance Technologies</h2>
                    
                    <h3>IP Camera Systems</h3>
                    <p>Modern IP cameras deliver high-resolution video over standard network infrastructure. Axseter installs cameras from leading manufacturers including Axis, Hanwha, Bosch, and Avigilon. We select camera models based on your specific requirements—indoor vs. outdoor, lighting conditions, resolution needs, and special features like wide dynamic range or low-light performance.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Cloud Video Platforms</h3>
                    <p>Cloud-based video surveillance has transformed how enterprises manage distributed video systems. Platforms like Verkada and Rhombus eliminate on-site servers, provide centralized access to all locations from a single dashboard, and include built-in analytics capabilities. Axseter is a certified installer for these platforms, ensuring optimal configuration from day one.</p>
                    
                    <h3>On-Premise NVR/VMS Systems</h3>
                    <p>For organizations that prefer on-premise video storage, we deploy network video recorders (NVRs) and video management systems (VMS) including Genetec, Milestone, and Avigilon. These systems provide powerful video management capabilities while keeping footage on-site—important for organizations with data sovereignty requirements or limited bandwidth.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Video Analytics</h3>
                    <p>Advanced video analytics transform cameras from passive recording devices into proactive security tools. We deploy systems with people counting, occupancy monitoring, line crossing detection, and behavioral analytics. For retail clients, analytics can provide valuable business intelligence beyond security—traffic patterns, dwell times, and conversion metrics.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Integration Capabilities</h3>
                    <p>Video surveillance is most powerful when integrated with other security systems. We configure integrations with access control platforms, intrusion detection systems, and alarm monitoring. When an access control event occurs, associated video is automatically bookmarked for easy retrieval.</p>

                    <h2>Common Questions</h2>
                </div>
                <div class="content-section">
                    <h3>What video surveillance platforms does Axseter install?</h3>
                    <p>Axseter installs all major commercial video surveillance platforms including Verkada, Rhombus, Avigilon, Genetec, Milestone, Axis, and Hanwha. We're platform-agnostic and work with your security team to select or deploy the system that best fits your requirements.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How many cameras does a typical location need?</h3>
                    <p>Camera count depends on location size, layout, and security objectives. A typical 3,000 sq ft clinic might need 6-10 cameras, while a 15,000 sq ft retail location could require 20-30. We install per your camera schedules and can conduct site assessments to verify placement feasibility and flag any field conditions that may require coordination.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Does Axseter support cloud-based video surveillance?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Cloud-based video platforms are increasingly popular for multi-location deployments because they eliminate on-site server management and provide centralized access to all locations. We're certified installers for leading cloud video providers including Verkada and Rhombus.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Can you integrate video with our access control system?</h3>
                    <p>Absolutely. Video-access integration provides valuable context by associating video footage with access events. When someone badges into a secured area, you can instantly view the associated video. We configure these integrations as part of our deployment scope.</p>
                    
                    <h3>What about storage and retention requirements?</h3>
                    <p>Storage requirements depend on camera count, resolution, frame rate, and retention period. For cloud systems, storage is included in the subscription. For on-premise systems, we size NVR storage based on your retention policies—typically 30-90 days for most commercial applications, longer for regulated industries.</p>
                    
                    <h3>How long does installation take?</h3>
                    <p>Installation timelines vary by location size and camera count. A typical 10-camera installation can be completed in 1-2 days. Larger deployments of 30+ cameras may require 3-5 days. We coordinate with your schedules to minimize operational disruption.</p>
