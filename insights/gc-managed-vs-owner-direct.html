    <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto px-6 lg:px-8 prose">
      <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">For most construction projects, low voltage gets bundled into the GC's scope. It's the path of least resistance. But for organizations operating 50, 100, or 500+ locations, this default approach creates compounding problems that don't surface until you're trying to troubleshoot a network issue in a store 1,200 miles away.</p>

      <h2>The Default: GC-Managed Low Voltage</h2>
      <p>Here's how it typically works: Your real estate team signs a lease. Construction engages a general contractor. The GC includes low voltage in their bid, then subs it out to whoever's available locally and fits the budget. You get a certificate of occupancy. Everyone moves on.</p>
      <p>This works fine for a single location. The problems emerge at scale.</p>

      <h2>The Hidden Costs of GC-Managed Installation</h2>
      
      <h3>1. Inconsistent Standards Across Locations</h3>
      <p>When a different subcontractor handles each site, you get different interpretations of "Cat6 cabling" and "standard installation." One location has neatly dressed cables with proper service loops. Another has cables zip-tied to sprinkler pipes. Both technically meet spec.</p>
      <p>This inconsistency creates real operational problems:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>IT teams can't rely on consistent port layouts or labeling conventions</li>
        <li>Troubleshooting requires starting from scratch at each location</li>
        <li>Equipment rack configurations vary wildly</li>
        <li>Documentation quality ranges from detailed to nonexistent</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. No Accountability After Certificate of Occupancy</h3>
      <p>The GC's warranty covers defects, but their relationship with you ends at CO. When you need a MAC (move, add, change) six months later, you're calling a subcontractor who did one job for the GC and has no ongoing relationship with your organization.</p>
      <p>Good luck getting them to prioritize your service call.</p>

      <h3>3. No Incentive Alignment</h3>
      <p>The GC's goal is certificate of occupancy, not your long-term infrastructure quality. They'll pick the sub who fits the schedule and budget, not the one who'll document properly or be available for service calls in six months. Their incentives end at CO; yours don't.</p>

      <h3>4. Knowledge Doesn't Compound</h3>
      <p>Every new location starts from zero. The lessons learned from your Denver buildout don't transfer to Phoenix. The installer in Phoenix has never seen your standard configuration. They're working from whatever drawings the architect provided, which may or may not reflect your actual requirements.</p>

      <h3>5. The Finger-Pointing Problem</h3>
      <p>When something goes wrong—and something always goes wrong—you get caught in a triangle between your GC, their low voltage sub, and your IT team. The GC says it was installed to spec. The sub says they followed the drawings. IT says the network doesn't work. Nobody owns the problem.</p>

      <h2>The Alternative: Owner-Direct Procurement</h2>
      <p>Owner-direct means you contract directly with a <strong>national low voltage contractor</strong> who handles all your locations. The GC still manages the construction site, but low voltage is carved out of their scope.</p>
      <p>This requires more coordination upfront but eliminates the compounding problems:</p>

      <h3>Consistent Standards</h3>
      <p>Same team, same standards, every location. Your 47th store is installed exactly like your first. IT can deploy equipment without site visits because they know exactly what they're getting.</p>

      <h3>Continuous Accountability</h3>
      <p>One vendor relationship that spans construction and ongoing operations. When you need service, you're calling someone who installed the system, knows your standards, and has an ongoing contract to protect.</p>

      <h3>Reduced Coordination Overhead</h3>
      <p>One relationship to manage instead of dozens. One contract to negotiate. One set of standards to communicate. The hours your team spends coordinating regional subs, chasing documentation, and resolving disputes disappear.</p>

      <h3>Institutional Knowledge</h3>
      <p>Every installation improves the next one. The team learns your quirks, your IT requirements, your preferred configurations. By location 20, they're anticipating problems before they happen.</p>

      <h2>When GC-Managed Makes Sense</h2>
      <p>To be fair, GC-managed low voltage isn't always wrong:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Single locations or very slow growth:</strong> If you're opening one location every two years, the coordination overhead of owner-direct may not be worth it.</li>
        <li><strong>Simple requirements:</strong> If your low voltage needs are genuinely basic—a few data drops and nothing else—the inconsistency matters less.</li>
        <li><strong>Markets with limited options:</strong> In some regions, there may not be a national contractor with local presence.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When Owner-Direct Becomes Essential</h2>
      <p>The math changes when:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You're operating 20+ locations</li>
        <li>You're opening 5+ new locations per year</li>
        <li>Your infrastructure includes access control, surveillance, or A/V beyond basic cabling</li>
        <li>IT standardization is a priority</li>
        <li>You've already experienced the pain of inconsistent installations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Making the Transition</h2>
      <p>Switching from GC-managed to owner-direct doesn't have to be all-or-nothing. Many organizations start by carving out low voltage on their next project, comparing the experience, then expanding from there.</p>
      <p>The key is getting low voltage specified as an owner-furnished/owner-installed (OFOI) item in your construction contracts. This removes it from the GC's scope cleanly and establishes clear coordination responsibilities.</p>

      <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>GC-managed low voltage is the default because it's easy, not because it's optimal. For single locations, the convenience outweighs the drawbacks. For multi-location operators, the hidden costs compound with every new site.</p>
      <p>The organizations that figure this out early build a structural advantage: consistent infrastructure, predictable costs, and IT teams that can actually support their locations without constant firefighting.</p>
