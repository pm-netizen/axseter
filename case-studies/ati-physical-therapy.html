                    <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                    <p>ATI Physical Therapy operates one of the largest outpatient physical therapy clinic networks in the United States. With over 900 clinics across 25 states, managing low-voltage infrastructure presents significant operational challenges at scale.</p>
                    
                    <p>Before engaging Axseter, ATI faced several pain points:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li><strong>Fragmented vendor relationships:</strong> Different contractors in different markets meant inconsistent service quality and complex vendor management</li>
                        <li><strong>Unpredictable service response:</strong> When infrastructure issues arose at clinics, resolution time varied widely depending on contractor availability</li>
                        <li><strong>Inconsistent installation standards:</strong> New clinic buildouts delivered varying quality depending on which contractor completed the work</li>
                        <li><strong>Administrative burden:</strong> The facilities team spent excessive time coordinating vendors rather than focusing on strategic initiatives</li>
                        <li><strong>Budget unpredictability:</strong> Pricing varied by market, making infrastructure cost forecasting difficult</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>ATI needed a partner who could provide consistent service across their entire footprint—from new clinic construction to ongoing support for existing locations.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>The Solution</h2>
                    <p>Axseter became ATI's Single Point of Contact for low-voltage infrastructure nationwide. The engagement spans both new clinic buildouts and ongoing support for existing locations.</p>
                    
                    <h3>New Clinic Construction</h3>
                    <p>For new clinic openings, Axseter delivers complete low-voltage infrastructure packages:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li><strong>Structured cabling:</strong> Network infrastructure supporting clinical workstations, therapy equipment connectivity, and patient check-in systems</li>
                        <li><strong>Access control:</strong> Secure entry systems for staff areas, controlled access to medication storage, and after-hours security</li>
                        <li><strong>Video surveillance:</strong> Camera coverage for entrances, parking areas, and reception supporting safety and loss prevention</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>Standardized deployment packages ensure every new ATI clinic receives consistent infrastructure regardless of location. Our project managers coordinate with ATI's construction team and general contractors to ensure installations align with build schedules.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Break-Fix Support</h3>
                    <p>For ATI's existing 900+ clinics, Axseter provides nationwide break-fix support with defined service levels. When a network drop fails in Phoenix or a card reader malfunctions in Philadelphia, ATI's facilities team makes one call to Axseter.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our service coordination dispatches from our national technician network, ensuring consistent response regardless of location. ATI benefits from:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li>Defined SLAs with 24-hour standard response</li>
                        <li>Single point of contact for all service requests</li>
                        <li>Consistent pricing across all markets</li>
                        <li>Service history documentation and reporting</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h3>Technology Refresh Programs</h3>
                    <p>Beyond reactive support, Axseter partners with ATI on proactive infrastructure improvements. When ATI standardizes on new access control platforms or upgrades surveillance systems, we execute the rollout across their clinic network systematically.</p>

                <div class="content-section">
                    <h2>The Results</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Simplified Operations</h3>
                    <p>ATI's facilities team no longer manages dozens of vendor relationships. One contract covers all locations. One invoice simplifies accounting. One relationship provides accountability for infrastructure performance nationwide.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Predictable Service Levels</h3>
                    <p>With defined SLAs and a national technician network, ATI knows what to expect when issues arise. The unpredictability of local contractor availability has been eliminated.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Consistent Quality</h3>
                    <p>Whether it's a new clinic buildout in Texas or a break-fix call in Ohio, ATI receives consistent service quality. Standardized processes and quality verification ensure reliable outcomes.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Cost Predictability</h3>
                    <p>Consistent pricing across all markets enables accurate budgeting. ATI's finance team can forecast infrastructure costs with confidence.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Reduced Administrative Burden</h3>
                    <p>Time previously spent sourcing contractors, negotiating terms, and managing vendor performance is now available for strategic work. The facilities team focuses on improving clinics rather than managing vendors.</p>

                    <h2>Partnership Model</h2>
                    <p>The ATI engagement demonstrates how Axseter's SPoC model scales to support large, distributed healthcare organizations:</p>
                    
                    <h3>Dedicated Account Management</h3>
                    <p>ATI has a dedicated Axseter account manager who understands their business, knows their standards, and ensures consistent service delivery. This isn't a call center relationship—it's a partnership with named contacts who know ATI's clinics.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Standardized Processes</h3>
                    <p>From service request intake to technician dispatch to work completion documentation, every interaction follows defined processes. This consistency enables the scale necessary to support 900+ locations effectively.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
                    <p>Regular business reviews identify trends, address recurring issues, and plan strategic improvements. The relationship evolves as ATI's needs change—whether that's supporting new clinic formats, rolling out new technologies, or entering new markets.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Flexible Engagement</h3>
                    <p>ATI leverages Axseter for both project work (new clinics, technology refreshes) and ongoing support (break-fix, MAC services). The relationship flexes to match their needs rather than forcing them into rigid service categories.</p>

                    <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                    <p>The ATI Physical Therapy partnership illustrates several principles for managing infrastructure at scale:</p>
                    
                    <ul class="content-list">
                        <li><strong>Scale demands standardization:</strong> 900+ locations can't be managed with ad-hoc processes—standardized specifications and procedures enable consistent delivery</li>
                        <li><strong>Vendor consolidation reduces complexity:</strong> One partner for all locations simplifies operations dramatically compared to market-by-market vendor management</li>
                        <li><strong>Ongoing support complements project work:</strong> The same partner who builds new clinics can support existing ones, creating continuity and institutional knowledge</li>
                        <li><strong>Defined SLAs create accountability:</strong> Clear service levels set expectations and enable performance measurement</li>
                        <li><strong>Partnership beats transaction:</strong> Long-term relationships with dedicated contacts outperform transactional vendor arrangements</li>
                    </ul>
