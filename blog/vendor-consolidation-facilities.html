        <p>If you manage facilities for an enterprise with 50+ locations, you already know the drill. Every market has its own low voltage contractor. Some are great. Some are adequate. A few are problems waiting to happen.</p>

        <p>You've built relationships over years. You know which contractors pick up the phone and which ones don't. You've learned to pad timelines because you can't predict which vendor will actually show up on schedule.</p>

        <p>This isn't a vendor problem. It's a structural problem. And the most sophisticated facilities teams in the country have stopped trying to manage around it.</p>

        <h2>The Hidden Cost of Regional Vendor Networks</h2>

        <p>The obvious costs are easy to track: invoices, change orders, service calls. But the hidden costs are where multi-vendor approaches actually break down.</p>

        <p><strong>Coordination overhead.</strong> Every new location means vetting contractors, negotiating rates, explaining standards, and hoping for the best. Multiply that by 30 new locations per year, and you've created a full-time job that doesn't exist on any org chart.</p>

        <p><strong>Inconsistent quality.</strong> Your Denver contractor does beautiful rack work. Your Phoenix contractor treats cable management as optional. Now your IT team has to troubleshoot problems that stem from installation quality—and they don't even know that's the root cause.</p>

        <p><strong>Knowledge loss.</strong> When a regional contractor changes crews—or goes out of business—you lose all institutional knowledge about your sites. The next vendor starts from zero.</p>

        <p><strong>Emergency response gaps.</strong> It's 6 PM on a Friday and your access control system just went down at a healthcare facility. Your regional vendor doesn't do after-hours. Now what?</p>

        <h2>What Single-Vendor Actually Means</h2>

        <p>Let's be clear about what we're describing. Single-vendor doesn't mean one company with a truck in every city. That model doesn't scale.</p>

        <p>Single-vendor means one company that:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Owns the relationship and accountability for every site</li>
          <li>Maintains a vetted network of installation partners who meet consistent standards</li>
          <li>Provides one point of contact regardless of geography</li>
          <li>Handles all coordination, scheduling, and quality control</li>
          <li>Delivers documentation in a standardized format you can actually use</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You're not buying trucks and technicians. You're buying a system that removes variability from your infrastructure deployment.</p>

        <h2>The Facilities Manager's Real Job</h2>

        <p>Here's what we've observed working with facilities teams at healthcare systems, retail chains, and financial services firms: the best facilities managers don't want to be vendor managers.</p>

        <p>They want to focus on:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Strategic planning for portfolio growth</li>
          <li>Energy efficiency and sustainability initiatives</li>
          <li>Capital project oversight</li>
          <li>Building systems optimization</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Every hour spent chasing a cabling contractor for as-builts is an hour not spent on work that actually moves the organization forward.</p>

        <h2>Making the Transition</h2>

        <p>Moving from a regional vendor model to a single-vendor model doesn't happen overnight. Here's how most organizations approach it:</p>

        <p><strong>Start with new locations.</strong> Keep existing vendor relationships for service and maintenance at current sites. Route all new construction and buildouts through your single vendor. This lets you evaluate performance without disrupting operations.</p>

        <p><strong>Establish standards documentation.</strong> Work with your vendor to create detailed specifications for every system type. This becomes the blueprint that ensures consistency regardless of which installation team does the work.</p>

        <p><strong>Transition service contracts over time.</strong> As you build confidence in the new model, migrate service and maintenance from regional vendors. Most organizations complete this transition over 12-24 months.</p>

        <h2>What to Look For</h2>

        <p>If you're evaluating a national low voltage partner, here's what matters:</p>

        <p><strong>Proven network depth.</strong> Can they actually cover your footprint? Ask for references in your specific markets—not just the easy ones.</p>

        <p><strong>Project management infrastructure.</strong> How do they handle scheduling, coordination, and communication? You should have visibility into every project without having to ask for updates.</p>

        <p><strong>Documentation standards.</strong> What do their as-builts look like? Can you actually use them two years from now when you need to make changes?</p>

        <p><strong>Service response capabilities.</strong> What's their SLA for emergency response? How do they handle after-hours issues?</p>

        <p><strong>Financial stability.</strong> A vendor relationship that spans hundreds of locations is a significant dependency. Make sure they'll be around.</p>

        <h2>The Outcome</h2>

        <p>Facilities teams that make this transition consistently report the same results: less time managing vendors, more predictable project outcomes, and infrastructure that actually performs consistently across the portfolio.</p>

        <p>That's not a vendor pitch. That's just what happens when you remove variability from a complex system.</p>

        <p>The question isn't whether single-vendor makes sense for multi-location enterprises. The question is whether your organization is ready to make the transition.</p>
